REMARKS:        At beginning of conversation, Speaker A has an electronic
feedback noise behind him.  Also, both speakers are very heavy breathers.  
You can hear them breathing throughout the conversation.  The breath noise 
notations I made are the loudest ones.  There is some background noise in 
Speaker B's office.
