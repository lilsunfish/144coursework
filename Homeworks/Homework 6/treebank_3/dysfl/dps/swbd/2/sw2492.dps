REMARKS:        Speaker A sounds like she's washing dishes or something,  
throughout the conversation.  I have noted when the noises are the loudest.   
The noises sound like water going down a drain and pouring water back and  
forth between glasses, and the loudest noises sound like banging or scraping  
plastic dishes on a counter.
