films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( <O />batman<O /> , <O />superman , <O />spawn<O /> ) , or geared toward kids ( <O />casper<O /> ) or the arthouse crowd ( <O />ghost world<O /> ) , but there's never really been a comic book like <M />from hell<M /> before . [e]
for starters , it was created by <P />alan moore<P /> ( and <P />eddie campbell<P /> ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . [o]
to say <P />moore<P /> and <P />campbell<P /> thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . [e]
the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . [o]
in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . [o]
if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in <M />from hell's<M /> directors , <P />albert<P /> and <P />allen hughes<P /> . [o]
getting the <P />hughes brothers<P /> to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in <S />the ghetto<S /> and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind <O />menace ii society<O /> ? [e]
<S />the ghetto<S /> in question is , of course ,<S /> whitechapel in 1888 london's east end<S /> .[p]
it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . [p]
when the first stiff turns up , <C />copper peter godley<C /> ( <A />robbie coltrane<A /> , <O />the world is not enough<O /> ) calls in inspector <C />frederick abberline<C /> ( <A />johnny depp<A /> , <O />blow<O /> ) to crack the case . [p]
<C />abberline<C /> , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . [p]
upon arriving in <S />whitechapel<S /> , he befriends an unfortunate named <C />mary kelly<C /> ( <A />heather graham<A /> , <O />say it isn't so<O /> ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . [p]
i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say <P />moore<P /> and <P />campbell<P /> have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . [e]
in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( <O />vertical limit<O /> ) and rafael yglesias ( <O />les mis ? rables<O /> ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . [e]
it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . [e]
and <M />from hell's<M /> ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( " who holds back the electric car/who made <A />steve guttenberg<A /> a star ? " ) . [o]
don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . [o]
now onto <M />from hell's<M /> appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than <O />planet of the apes<O /> did ( at times , it seems like <O />sleepy hollow 2<O /> ) . [o]
the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer <P />peter deming<P /> ( <O />don't say a word<O /> ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . [e]
oscar winner <P />martin childs'<P /> ( <O />shakespeare in love<O /> ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . [e]
even the acting in <M />from hell<M /> is solid , with the dreamy <A />depp<A /> turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . [e]
<A />ians holm<A /> ( <O />joe gould's secret<O /> ) and <A />richardson<A /> ( <O />102 dalmatians<O /> ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is <A />graham<A /> . [e]
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . [g]
the film , however , is all good . [e] <L />
2 : 00<L /> - <R />r<R /> for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content
