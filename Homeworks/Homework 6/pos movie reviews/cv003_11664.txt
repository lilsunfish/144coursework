 <M />" jaws "<M /> is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . [e]
the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . [p]
then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . [p][o]
dah-dum . [o]
from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . [p]
right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once <M />" jaws "<M /> has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . [p]
perhaps what is most outstanding about <M />" jaws "<M /> is how spielberg builds the movie . [e]
he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . [o]
unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . [p]
until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . [p]
he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . [e][p]
he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . [e]
the first act opens with police chief <C />martin brody<C /> ( <A />roy scheider<A /> ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .[p]
the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , <C />larry vaughn<C /> ( <A />murray hamilton<A /> ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . [p]
<C />brody<C /> is joined by <C />matt hooper<C /> ( <A />richard dreyfuss<A /> ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . [p]
<C />hooper<C /> is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help <C />brody<C /> stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( " it's a perfect engine , an eating machine " ) make it that much more terrifying . [p]
when <C />vaughn<C /> finally relents , <C />hooper<C /> and <C />brody<C /> join a crusty old shark killer named <C />quint<C /> ( <A />robert shaw<A /> ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . [p]
the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . [p]
 <M />" jaws "<M /> is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . [e]
it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by " star wars " ) . [e]
even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's <O />" psycho , "<O /> and it never seems to age . [e]
although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . [e]
the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . [e][g]
<A />scheider<A /> , <A />dreyfuss<A /> , and <A />shaw<A /> were known actors at the time <M />" jaws "<M /> was made , but none of them had the draw of a <A />robert redford<A /> or <A />paul newman<A /> . [e]
nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . [e][g]
<A />scheider<A /> hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . [e]
 " it's your first summer here , you know , " <C />mayor vaughn<C /> warns him . [p]
<A />dreyfuss<A /> , who had previously been seen in <O />" american graffiti "<O /> ( 1973 ) and<O /> " the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "<O /> ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . [e]
however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by <A />robert shaw<A /> as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . [e]
bordering of parody , <A />shaw<A /> plays <C />quint<C /> as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . [p]
he's slightly deranged , and <A />shaw's<A /> performance is almost a caricature . [e]
however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and <C />brody<C /> and <C />hooper<C /> are below deck on the orca comparing scars . [p]
<C />quint<C /> is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . 
indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . [p]
his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . [p][e]
<A />shaw<A /> delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . [e]
of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . [e][p]
a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in <M />" jaws , "<M /> and they are a threat . [e][g]
every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . [g]
the shark in <M />" jaws "<M /> was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed " bruce " by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .[o] 
many have forgotten , but <M />" jaws "<M /> was a sort of precursor to <O />" waterworld "<O /> ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . [e]
but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . [e]
